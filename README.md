# Forest Fire Detection Using Tensorflow  
The project aims to detect forest fire by using a TensorFlow model that is trained on the images.  

Download the `source_code.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/PrathamGupta06/Forest-Fire-Detection-Using-Tensorflow/releases/tag/v1.0.0)  

Extract the folder  

Install the required dependencies  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`  

Open Jupyter Notebook:  
run `jupyter notebook` in command prompt in the project directory to open jupyter notebook.  

## To use the pretrained model:  
The model trained by me is stored in saved_model directory.  
Open jupyter notebook.  
Open `model_testing.ipynb` for the testing data.  
The notebook is commented properly for the further instructions.  

## To train the model manually:  

Open jupyter notebook.  
Open `model_training_and_saving.ipynbb` for the testing data.  
The notebook is commented properly for the further instructions.  

Please open a new issue if you face any difficulty.
